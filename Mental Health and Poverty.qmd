# Poverty and Mental Health Using Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS)

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

#| label: Setting up the quarto for data cleaning
#| include: false

library(readr) #Run for every new R session

#Source an R script that has imported ASCII file and data-cleaned, extracting only relevant variables
source ("Loading and cleaning h243.R")

#Source an R script that merges full year consolidated and medical conditions file 
source("Merged h243 and h241.R")

#Source all 
source("Added h239a to data.R")

print(all_merged)

my_data <- all_merged
```

```{r}
#|label: Categorical variables to factors

my_data <- my_data %>%
  mutate(
    MNHLTH31 = as.factor(MNHLTH31),   # Perceived Mental Health
    POVCAT22 = as.factor(POVCAT22),   # Poverty Level
    SEX = as.factor(SEX),             # Gender
    INSURC22 = as.factor(INSURC22),   # Insurance Status
    EMPST31 = as.factor(EMPST31)      # Employment Status
  )

table(my_data$POVCAT22)
table(my_data$MNHLTH31)

```

```{r}
#|label: Summary Statistics 
#|include: true

summary(my_data[, c("psych_drug_count", "psych_count", "RXEXP22", "RXSLF22", "MNHLTH31", "POVCAT22")])

```

```{r}
#| label: tbl-h243_categorized
#| include: true
#| tbl-cap: "Poverty and Perceived Mental Health"
#| apa-note: Extracted relevant variables from 2022 Full Year Consolidated File

#install.packages("flextable")  # Install flextable if you haven't already
library(flextable)  # Load flextable

head(all_merged) %>% #With categorized rows but no medical conditions file information
  flextable() %>%
  flextable::theme_apa()

```

```{r}
#| label: Logistic Regression - Poverty and Perceived Mental Health
logit_model <- glm(MNHLTH31 ~ POVCAT22 + AGE31X + SEX + INSURC22 + EMPST31 + EDUCYR,
                   data = my_data, 
                   family = binomial())

## Interpreting logistic regression of poverty and 

All other groups of poverty have no stastically signficant association with mental health, but the high-income group **High Income (-0.4580, p < 0.001)** has the strongest negative effect, indicating that higher income significantly reduces the likelihood of reporting poor mental health. Overall, Middle and High Income groups show the strongest effects.

Females (SEXfemale = 0.0915, p = 0.028) are slightly more likely to report poor mental health than males.

Given **-0.0174, p = 0.0116** of association between MNHLTH31 and EDUCYR, we can conclude that higher education slightly reduces the likelihood of poor mental health.

Age is not a significant predictor in poor mental health. 

```{r}
#| label: Logistic Regression - Poverty and Diagnosed Mental Health Condition
logit_model <- glm(psych_count ~ POVCAT22 + AGE31X + SEX + INSURC22 + EMPST31 + EDUCYR,
                   data = my_data, 
                   family = binomial())

summary(logit_model)
```


```{r}
#| label: Logistic Regression - Prescription Expenditure & Mental Health 

lm_model <- lm(RXSLF22 ~ MNHLTH31 + POVCAT22 + AGE31X + SEX + INSURC22 + EMPST31 + EDUCYR + psych_drug_count, data = my_data)

library(ggplot2)

#Mental health by poverty level
ggplot(all_merged, aes(x = MNHLTH31, fill = POVCAT22)) +
    geom_bar(position = "fill") +
    labs(title = "Perceived Mental Health by Poverty Level", x = "Mental Health Status", y = "Proportion") +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
    theme_minimal()

#Insurance status and medication expenditure disparities

```

```

```{r}
#|label: Visualization of merged data 

ggplot(h241h243_merged, aes(x = POVCAT22, y = RXEXP22)) + geom_bar() + 
  labs(title = "Prescription Expenditure by Poverty Level", x = "Poverty Level", y = "Total Prescription Expenditure")

```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
