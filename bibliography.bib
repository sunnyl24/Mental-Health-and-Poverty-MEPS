  abstract = {Policy Points: We take advantage of Oregon's Medicaid lottery to gauge the causal effects of Medicaid coverage on mental health care, how effectively it addresses unmet needs, and how those effects differ for those with and without a history of depression. Medicaid coverage reduced the prevalence of undiagnosed depression by almost 50\% and untreated depression by more than 60\%. It increased use of medications and reduced the share of respondents reporting unmet mental health care needs by almost 40\%. There are likely to be substantial mental health consequences of policy decisions about Medicaid coverage for vulnerable populations. Context Expanding Medicaid to previously uninsured adults has been shown to increase detection and reduce the prevalence of depression, but the ways that Medicaid affects mental health care, how effectively it addresses unmet needs, and how those effects differ for those with and without a history of depression remain unclear. Methods We take advantage of Oregon's Medicaid lottery to gauge the causal effects of Medicaid coverage using a randomized-controlled design, drawing on both primary and administrative data sources. Findings Medicaid coverage reduced the prevalence of undiagnosed depression by almost 50\% and untreated depression by more than 60\%. It increased use of medications frequently prescribed to treat depression and related mental health conditions and reduced the share of respondents reporting unmet mental health care needs by almost 40\%. The share of respondents screening positive for depression dropped by 9.2 percentage points overall, and by 13.1 for those with preexisting depression diagnoses, with greatest relief in symptoms seen primarily in feeling down or hopeless, feeling tired, and trouble sleeping---consistent with the increase observed not just in medications targeting depression but also in those targeting sleep. Conclusions Medicaid coverage had significant effects on the diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes of a population with substantial unmet mental health needs. Coverage increased access to care, reduced the prevalence of untreated and undiagnosed depression, and substantially improved the symptoms of depression. There are likely to be substantial mental health consequences of policy decisions about Medicaid coverage for vulnerable populations.},

It is imperative to determine the role of affordability in influencing access to health care and medications.

Delay in receiving health care services and delay in obtaining prescription medications.           A cross-sectional analysis of the 2017 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey using multivariate logistic regressions with Expenditure and Expenditure Share variables standardized to facilitate comparison.           While both absolute and relative financial burdens were found to be positively associated with the outcomes, the relative measure had a significantly higher association that was about twice as much as the absolute one. For the outcome of delay in getting health care, the standardized odds ratios (OR) for health care expenditure and health care expenditure as a share of family income were 1.13 (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.09--1.18) and 1.25 (95\% CI = 1.20--1.32), respectively. For the outcome of delay in getting medications, the standardized OR for medication expenditure and medication expenditure as a share of family income were 1.11 (95\% CI = 1.08--1.15) and 1.23 (95\% CI = 1.18--1.29), respectively.

  abstract = {Objective Medicare Part D provides formulary protections for antipsychotics, but does not exempt these drugs from cost-sharing. We investigated the impact of Part D coverage on antipsychotic drug spending, adherence, and clinical outcomes among beneficiaries with varying indications for use. Methods We conducted a historical cohort study of Medicare Advantage beneficiaries who received antipsychotic drugs, with diagnoses of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, or no mental health diagnoses (N=10,190). Half had a coverage gap; half had no gap because of low-income subsidies. Using fixed effects regression models, we examined changes in spending and adherence as beneficiaries experienced cost-sharing increases after reaching the gap. We examined changes in hospitalizations and emergency department visits using proportional hazard models. Results Across all diagnostic groups, monthly total antipsychotic spending decreased with cost-sharing increases in the gap compared with those with no gap (e.g., schizophrenia: -\$123 [-\$138, -\$108]), and out-of-pocket spending increased (e.g., schizophrenia: \$104 [\$98, \$110]). Adherence similarly decreased, with the largest declines among those with schizophrenia (-20.6 percentage points [-22.3, -18.9] in proportion of days covered). Among beneficiaries with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, hospitalizations and emergency department visit rates increased with cost-sharing increases (e.g., schizophrenia: HR=1.32 [1.06, 1.65] for all hospitalizations), but did not among subjects without mental health diagnoses. Clinical event rates did not change among beneficiaries with low income subsidies without gaps. Conclusions There is evidence of interruptions in antipsychotic use attributable to Part D cost-sharing. Adverse events increased among beneficiaries with approved indications for use, but not among beneficiaries without such indications.},

College students in general are at high risk for mental health disorders, and Latinx college students face unique stressors placing them at greater risk of psychological distress. Social support may be a key construct in improving outcomes for college students; however, few studies have empirically tested whether the protective effect of social support is equivalent across racial/ethnic groups. Using a series of regression models, we investigated whether social support moderates the relationship between perceived stress and endorsement of depression and anxiety symptoms in Latinx (n = 265) and non-Latinx White college students (n = 216) and whether this moderating effect varied by group membership. Participants completed a series of questionnaires measuring social support, perceived stress, and depression and anxiety symptoms. The moderating effects of social support varied by group membership and outcomes (i.e., depression and anxiety). Social support moderated the relationship between perceived stress and depression symptoms for both Latinx and non-Latinx White students. However, social support only buffered the effect of perceived stress on anxiety symptom endorsement for Latinx college students. These findings suggest that social support does not function uniformly across racial/ethnic groups or the endorsement of depression and anxiety symptoms. Social support may be particularly important for Latinx students by providing a buffer between perceived stress and symptoms of anxiety.},

Methods: This study used data from the US Medical Expenditure Panel Survey for 2008--2021. Multivariable generalized estimating equations were used to measure associations between employment precarity (operationalized as a multi-dimensional exposure) and self-rated mental health after adjusting for relevant confounders. Marginal effects analysis was used to assess potential dose-response relationships between precarity and mental health. Results: Our sample (n = 57,529) was representative of more than 106 million US workers employed throughout 2008--2021. Compared to those with low levels of employment precarity, those with medium and high levels of precarity had an increased odds of reporting poor/fair mental health (aOR = 1.21; 95\% CI = 1.11, 1.32 and 1.51; 95\% CI = 1.36, 1.68, respectively). Marginal effects analysis indicated that increasing levels of precarity were associated with an increased probability of reporting poor/fair mental health. Conclusions: Increasing levels of employment precarity were associated with poor/fair self-rated mental health, findings potentially indicative of a dose-response relationship between the two. These nationally representative findings suggest employment precarity is an important social determinant of mental health. Future research could investigate how best to mitigate the negative effects of precarity on workers' lives and well-being, particularly regarding mental health.},

This perspective article offers different perspectives of poverty and its reciprocal association with mental illness and outlines possible future research and policy implications. We will approach the topic of poverty from various levels: On a micro-level, focusing on absolute poverty with precarious housing and malnutrition. On a meso-level, on neighborhood-related poverty as a factor in individuals' mental illness. On a macro-level, on effects of income inequality on mental health. In several studies, it has been shown that on each level, poverty has a profound impact on mental health, though it must be noted that in some fields, research is still scarce. In the future, an inter- and transdisciplinary approach is of considerable importance, since poverty and its impact on mental health should be addressed from different perspectives, reaching from targeted programs for individual groups (e.g., homeless people) up to national policy measures.},

We report the findings of the first systematic survey of leaders of psychiatry in nearly 60 countries on the strategies for reducing the treatment gap. We sought to elicit the views of these representatives on the roles of different human resources and health care settings in delivering care and on the importance of a range of strategies to increase the coverage of evidence-based treatments for priority mental disorders for each demographic stage (childhood, adolescence, adulthood and old age). Our findings clearly indicate three strategies for reducing the treatment gap: increasing the numbers of psychiatrists and other mental health professionals; increasing the involvement of a range of appropriately trained non-specialist providers; and the active involvement of people affected by mental disorders. This is true for both high income and low/middle income countries, though relatively of more importance in the latter. We view this survey as a critically important first step in ascertaining the position of psychiatrists, one of the most influential stakeholder communities in global mental health, in addressing the global challenge of scaling up mental health services to reduce the treatment gap.},

It is found that prescription drug utilization is characterized by two stochastic regimes requiring use of latent class modelling framework. In many instances, results differ for the classes of high and low users of prescription drugs. After accounting for the unobserved individual heterogeneity and a number of socio-demographic factors, health status, and province fixed effects, we find that having prescription drug insurance (public or private) increases the expected number of non-psychotropic medications for both low and high users. Public insurance affects psychotropic drug utilization positively for the low-user group only. The statistical insignificance of insurance for the high-user psychotropic drugs or lower magnitude of insurance coefficients on high-user non-psychotropic drugs seems to stem from high inelastic demand for prescription drugs in the concerned groups. In addition, we find that age, self-reported health status, and long-term mental and physical health problem diagnosed by a health professional are important determinants of prescription drug utilization for both classes of users.},
