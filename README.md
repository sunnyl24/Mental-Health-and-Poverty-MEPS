# D2MR Final Project 

## Project Rationalte  
This project is my final submission for the Data to Manuscript Using R course. I will analyze data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) to examine the association between insurance levels and psychiatric drug exposure. The study aims to highlight health disparities that arise from financial constraints, particularly in the context of mental health access.

##Research Direction: Research Direction
**Research Question**: What is the relationship between insurance coverage and exposure to psychiatric drugs?
**Hypothesis**: Individuals with better insurance coverage will have greater exposure to psychiatric medications.
**Directionality**: This study assumes a positive association between comprehensive insurance coverage and higher psychiatric drug utilization.

### Why This Matters:
Poverty often limits access to essential healthcare services, including mental health treatment and prescription medications. By investigating how insurance coverage influences psychiatric drug exposure, this study seeks to identify at-risk populations who may face barriers to treatment. Understanding these disparities is crucial for informing policy interventions that can improve healthcare accessibility for underserved communities.

### Long-Term Research Goals:
As an undergraduate researcher, my broader interest lies in understanding how social risks shape individual healthcare experiences. Insurance status is just one dimension of these social risks, yet it plays a critical role in determining access to effective psychiatric treatment. By focusing on insurance and psychiatric drug exposure, I aim to explore how systemic barriers impact medical access and treatment adherence.

### Future Directions:
Psychotropic medications are among the most effective treatments for mental health disorders. However, access disparities can prevent the most vulnerable populations from benefiting. Looking ahead, I hope to investigate how social risks influence access to pharmacogenomic advancements, which have the potential to personalize medication regimens based on genetic profiles. Ultimately, understanding who lacks access to prescription drugs today will help determine how we can tailor pharmacogenomic treatments to benefit those most in need.
