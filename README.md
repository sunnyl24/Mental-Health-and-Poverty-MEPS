# D2MR Final Project 

**Mental Health and Poverty MEPS**

This is my final project for the Data to Manuscript Using R class. I will be utilizing the publicly available database Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) to determine the association between the chosen measure of poverty and mental health prescription expenditure. 
The purpose of thus study is to elucidate health disparities that arise from financial constraints. Poverty often leads to reduced access to mental health services and prescription medications. Investigating how poverty affects mental health conditions and expenditures allows us to identify at-risk groups for targeted interventions.
